# EcoTrack ♻️

EcoTrack is a platform designed to revolutionize recycling by directly connecting users with recycling centers, ensuring a transparent, trust-based system for waste collection and payment without intermediaries.

## Features

- **Request Waste Collection**: Users can book a request to have their plastic waste collected.
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Track the collector in real-time as they arrive to pick up the waste.
- **QR Code Verification**: A QR scan ensures accurate weight reporting, resolving trust issues.
- **Admin Control**: Recycling center owners manage the process and ensure fair payment directly to the users.
- **Collector Tracking**: Users can track their waste according to the collector assigned.

## How It Works

1. Users place a request for waste collection.
2. A collector confirms the request and picks up the waste.
3. Users track the collector’s location in real-time.
4. At the recycling center, the collector scans a QR code to confirm the weight of the waste.

## Key Insights

During development, the team learned the importance of careful planning and structuring code. Thinking through the design and architecture of the system before coding ensured smooth implementation and reduced errors.
